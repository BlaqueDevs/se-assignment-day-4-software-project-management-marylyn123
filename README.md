## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
eature	Agile Methodology	Waterfall Methodology
Agile and Waterfall are two widely used software development methodologies, each with distinct approaches, advantages, and challenges.

Agile is an iterative and incremental methodology that emphasizes flexibility, continuous feedback, and adaptability. It allows for changes at any stage of development, making it ideal for projects where requirements may evolve over time. Agile development is divided into small iterations called sprints, where working software is released frequently. This approach encourages close collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and customers, ensuring the final product aligns with user needs. However, Agile can be challenging in terms of cost and timeline estimation, as requirements are continuously refined throughout the project. It also requires active customer involvement, which may not always be feasible.

In contrast, Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase (such as requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. This structure makes it easier to plan and estimate project costs and timelines upfront. Waterfall works best for projects with well-defined, stable requirements, as it does not accommodate changes easily once development has started. While the structured nature of Waterfall ensures thorough documentation and clear milestones, it lacks flexibility. Testing occurs late in the process, which can lead to costly errors if major issues are discovered near the end of development.

The choice between Agile and Waterfall depends on project needs. Agile is best suited for dynamic projects requiring quick adjustments and iterative improvements, such as mobile apps or web-based platforms. Waterfall is preferable for projects with fixed requirements and regulatory constraints, such as government or large-scale enterprise applications.
